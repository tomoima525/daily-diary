# üé¨ Daily Diary ‚Äî AI That Turns Your Daily day into a beutiful memory

## 1. Concept

Daily Diary lets users create short daily videos just by talking.
Before bed, you tell the AI about your day ‚Äî it listens, understands the story, finds related photos and videos, adds narration and music, and produces a short ‚Äúmemory movie.‚Äù
It captures not only what happened, but how it felt.

## 2. Problem

For busy parents (like me), days move too fast.
I take pictures and videos of my kids, but rarely have time to organize or edit them.
Those small, emotional moments fade away in photo folders.
I wanted a simple way to preserve those memories ‚Äî not just visually, but emotionally.

## 3. Solution

Just speak to the AI each night.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired but happy ‚Äî we went to the beach and watched the sunset.‚Äù

Voice Diary will:

- Transcribe and summarize your story
- Create a captions for the photo that you uploaded
- Generate a short film with voice narration, captions, and music

The next morning, your day becomes a beautiful highlight video.
